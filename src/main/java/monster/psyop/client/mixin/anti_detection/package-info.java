package monster.psyop.client.mixin.anti_detection;

// May be counterproductive, but will aim to reduce automatic detections, prevent malicious servers, ect.
// For context, we were recently trolling on a server, harmless stuff, and then something tried to crash my game, it was prevented automatically but still wasn't very nice.
