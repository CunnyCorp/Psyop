# FAQ

* How do I open the GUI?

    * The default key for opening the GUI in psyop is **L**.


* How do I change the GUI keybind?

    * Press L to open gui -> Click on the views button in the top left of your screen -> Open the modules window -> Select Client category -> Right Click Config module -> Change the GUI keybind to your preferred key


* WHY DO I HAVE TO CONFIGURE EVERYTHING!!!1!!!1 / WHY GUI WEIRD

    * The GUI uses ImGui which has a couple massive benefits:
      * It's easy to add new Views/Elements
      * When updating through MC versions it's extremely easy.
      * Renders after the game is done (including other mods)
    * Psyop has a simple design, it's up to the user to choose what they want to use.


* What version does Psyop support?

    * Psyop currently supports minecraft version 1.21.8, it will never support older versions.


* Why choose Psyop?

    * Psyop is the only public open source client available for the 9b9t community that caters to their needs and actively bypasses 9b9t's custom Grim AC.
